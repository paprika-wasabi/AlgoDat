# Answer to Task 2 letter a

Description of the Algorithm:
The algorithm takes as input an array A of length n. It goes through an index-loop i from 1 up to n - 1. 
For each i in that loop, it goes through another index-loop j from 0 up to i - 1. 
For each A[i] and A[j], it reads their corresponding value and subtract A[i] - A[j]. 
This operation yields its result as an absolute value. Finally, it compares whether that result is an element of that array A. 

Analysis of the Algorithm:
Since this algorithm has three loops, and each of them has a running time of O(n), then the whole algorithm's running time will be O(n^3).  



# Answer to Task 2 letter b 

The relevant problem in this context might be summarized as follows: given an array A of length n, check whether the difference between an element in index-position i (beginning at 0 up to n-1 position) and an element in index-position j (beginning at 0 up to i-1, i.e. always an element prior to the element in i), is already in any position k (ranging from 0 up to n-1) of A. Call this algorithm (as described in task 2 and summarized here) algorithm A (for short ALG-A)

An alternative algorithm to ALG-A for the same problem using the hashing technique may be described as follows, call it Algorithm B (for short AGL-B): 

 ht = HashTable(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(0, i - 1):
            ht.insert(arr[i] - arr[j])
    for i in range(n):
        if ht.find(arr[i]) is True:
            print(True)
        else:
            print(False)

ALG-B carries out all the subtractions between an element in index-position i and an element in index-position j (as above-described). 
Immediately after each subtraction, it stores the result as a kex in a Hashtable. 
To check whether a stored result is in the array, the algorithm performs a find-query through all keys in the Hashtable. 
If this check is positive, it prints true; otherwise, false.

Running Time of ALG-B: 
The running time of ALG-B is O(n^2 + n), since it has one for-loop within another for-loop (n^2) plus an independent for-loop (n). 



# Answer to Task 2 letter c

Now, an approach to make ALG-A run in a time of O(n^2 log n) without using the hashing technique is to eliminate the third for-loop at line 3 (in the pseudocode as described in task 2) and use a memonization method or checking directly whether the result of the above-mentioned subtraction is in array A.
